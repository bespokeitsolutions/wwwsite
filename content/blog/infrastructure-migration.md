Considering migratinon of infrastructure to cloud?
--------------------------------------------------

### Why you should consider migrating to a cloud provider?

There are reasons like cost effectivty, you can reduce the cost of hosting your own server. Benefits like high-availability, scaling and auto-scaling. You avoid additonal costs for hardware, you can easily upscale or downscale your cloud servers based on your needs.

### What are caveats of migration to cloud provider?

You don't know where are your data in terms of physical location, you just believe they are somewhere. Loosing control over the data is significant especially when you are working with sensitive data. You don't know who exactly can access your or your customer's data. Large cloud providers like Amazon, Google or Microsoft have agreements with various national institutions, which is not wrong, but you're just passing keys from your data to unknown amount of institutions. Large part of data business is advertising and big data analytics. Keep this in mind before you start the migration.

### What's the cost of migration?

Back in the days there was one system administrator in small or mid size business, who was managing "everything" from desktops, servers, emails, accouting, HR to telephony. That's lot of power over the data and lot of responsibility for one person. When you migrate to cloud, you can split this over various service providers, internal teams or outsourcing companies. There is little bit of overhead for such systems, usually it's understanding of capabilities of cloud providers and how you can use their services in optimal and cost effective way.

### Planning a migration?

Before you start your migration is good to get a hosting analysis and recommendation, what should or possibly should not be migrated. It's easy to push your data away, but little bit harder to get them back from the cloud. Such migration suppose to be planned in advance and you usually don't want to migrate back or to some other cloud provider sooner than in three years. Migration itself has a cost, extra work, extra pressure for various departments within your business. The cost effectivity usually brings savings within a year.
